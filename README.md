If you are bored of switching applications just to find meaning of few words while you are reading something.
Tired of conventional methods of searching meaning of words online then this script will simplify it for you.
Just start it by running python audDict.py and you are ready to use it.
Say the word you do not know meaning of and it will tell you what it means.

Just like its name audDict it will be really **addict**ive
